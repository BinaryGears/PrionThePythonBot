# PrionThePythonBot
This is the source code of a Discord bot that I made in python3. 

You will need python 3 and a few libraries that you can see from the imports part of the code but the main library you will need is discordpy. This bot was made for fun and for me to get an idea of how Discord bots work.

I will make this readme more detailed in the future with more info on how to setup and run the code but just know that you will need to do a few things before the code will work... setup a bot app with Discord to get a bot token, make an env file with the token, and make the json files. This code is not complete and I will still need to do a few more things before I feel like calling this complete but for now here is what I have.
